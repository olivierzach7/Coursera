Data from various text files from the HAR dataset are merged using the rbind function
Columns with mean and standard deviation are extracted from the dataset
Column names are updated from the features.txt
Activity names are inputted into the dataset from activity_labels.txt
A final dataset is produced - taking the average for each subject and activity type - and outputted to averages_data.txt


x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files
datax, datay and datasub merge the the test and training files together
feat and extractfeat variable extract mean and standard deviation from features.txt to append to datax
process is repeated for datay but with activity_labels.txt
datacomb is the total dataset - combining datax, datay, and datasub - all manipulated with previous analysis steps
avgcalc calculated the average for each subject and activity
exptable contains the write function of the final dataset
